# Budget App

This is a prototype budgeting application based on the popular budgeting web app You Need A Budget (YNAB).

The project is in no way associated with YNAB; my reasons for building it are:
1. I love YNAB
2. I'd like to have a budgeting app that keeps all my data offline
3. I am using it as a testbed for the Rust UI library `slint`
